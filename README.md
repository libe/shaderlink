# Shaderlink

*Note:* As google code is shutting down I needed to to find a place to host this great side project I made while in college so I guess github fits the bill pretty well.

Shaderlink is a RenderMan shader authoring tool. It lets you build shaders by placing shading nodes and connecting them through links. It was inspired by similar tools like Sler, ShaderMan and mental mill.

Shaderlink was developed in Python. The gui was built using the wonderful toolkit QT from Trolltech. Some image conversion stuff was done using PIL (Python Imaging Library). Currently 3Delight and PRMan are the the only RenderMan compliant renderers supported.

Supported platforms:
  * Fedora 11
  * Mac OSX Snow Leopard
  * Windows Vista/7

Supported renderers:
  * PRMan 
  * 3delight

Libraries needed:
  * QT >= 4.6 (PyQt binding) (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download)
  * Python 2.6 (http://www.python.org)
  * PIL (Python Image Library) (http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
